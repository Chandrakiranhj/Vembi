# Vembi Inventory Management System Guide for AI Assistant

This document provides comprehensive information about the Vembi Inventory Management & QC System to help the AI assistant better guide users and answer questions about the system's functionality.

## System Overview

The Vembi Inventory Management & QC System is a comprehensive platform for managing inventory, assembly processes, quality control, and production planning. The system includes several key modules:

1. **Inventory Management**: Tracking components, stock batches, and inventory levels
2. **Bill of Materials (BOM) Management**: Defining component requirements for products
3. **Assembly Control**: Managing the assembly process and component usage
4. **Quality Control**: Tracking defects and managing quality assurance
5. **Returns Processing**: Handling product returns and repairs
6. **Reporting & Analytics**: Data-driven insights about inventory and production
7. **User Management**: Role-based access control for different system functions

## Data Model and Relationships

### Core Entities

- **Products**: Finished goods that Vembi manufactures
- **Components**: Individual parts used to build products
- **Stock Batches**: Specific batches of components with tracking information
- **BOM (Bill of Materials)**: Recipe of components needed for each product
- **Assemblies**: Records of products being built, with component usage
- **Defects**: Quality issues found in components or assemblies
- **Users**: System users with different roles and permissions

### Key Relationships

- Products have a Bill of Materials (BOM) that specifies the required components
- Components are received in Stock Batches from vendors
- Assemblies consume components from specific stock batches
- Defects can be reported against specific components or assemblies
- Users interact with the system based on their assigned roles

## BOM Management in Detail

### What is a Bill of Materials (BOM)?

The Bill of Materials is a comprehensive list of components required to manufacture a product. Each BOM entry specifies:

- Which component is needed
- How many units of that component are required
- The BOM serves as the "recipe" or "blueprint" for assembling products

### BOM Management Interface

The system includes a dedicated BOM Management interface that allows administrators to:

1. **View Existing BOMs**: Select a product and see all components required
2. **Edit Component Quantities**: Change how many units of each component are needed
3. **Add New Components**: Add components that weren't previously part of the BOM
4. **Remove Components**: Remove components that are no longer needed
5. **Save Changes**: Update the BOM in the database

### How to Use BOM Management

1. Select a product from the dropdown menu
2. The system loads the existing BOM components in a table view
3. To modify a quantity:
   - Click the Edit button (pencil icon) on a component row
   - Enter the new quantity
   - Click the Save button (disk icon) to confirm
4. To add a new component:
   - Click the "Add Component" button
   - Select a component from the dropdown
   - Enter the required quantity
   - Click "Add to BOM"
5. To remove a component:
   - Click the Remove button (trash icon) on the component row
6. After making all changes, click "Save Changes" to update the database

### Impact of BOM Changes

When you modify a BOM:

1. **Assembly Process**: Changes affect what components are required during assembly
2. **Inventory Planning**: Impacts inventory requirements and stock level calculations
3. **Production Capacity**: Changes the calculation of how many products can be produced
4. **AI Assistant Knowledge**: The AI uses this data to answer questions about production capacity

## Assembly Process

Assemblies are created by:

1. Selecting a product to assemble
2. The system automatically identifies the required components based on the BOM
3. Components are allocated from available stock batches
4. The assembly process tracks which specific component batches were used
5. Once completed, the assembly is marked as finished and ready for quality control

### Connection Between BOM and Assembly

- The BOM dictates what components and quantities are needed for an assembly
- When creating a new assembly, the system checks if sufficient components are available
- The maximum production capacity is determined by the available components and the BOM requirements
- If a component is missing from the BOM, it won't be included in assemblies

## How the AI Uses BOM and Inventory Data

The AI assistant can answer questions about:

1. **Production Capacity**: "How many units of Product X can I produce?"
   - The AI calculates this by comparing current inventory levels with BOM requirements
   - It identifies the limiting component (the one that would be depleted first)

2. **Inventory Status**: "Do I have enough components to build 10 units of Product Y?"
   - The AI checks the BOM for Product Y, multiplies each component requirement by 10
   - It compares these needs against current inventory levels

3. **Component Usage**: "Which products use Component Z?"
   - The AI searches all BOMs to find products that include the specified component

4. **Missing Components**: "What components do I need to order for Product X?"
   - The AI identifies components from the BOM that have insufficient inventory

## Common User Questions and How to Answer

### About BOM Management

**Q: "How do I add a new component to a product?"**
A: "Select the product in the BOM Management screen, click 'Add Component', choose the component from the dropdown, enter the quantity needed, then click 'Save Changes' to update the database."

**Q: "I modified a BOM but my assemblies still show old requirements?"**
A: "BOM changes only affect new assemblies created after the changes were saved. Existing assemblies maintain their original component requirements."

**Q: "What happens if I remove a component from a BOM?"**
A: "Removing a component means it will no longer be required for new assemblies of that product. The system will no longer count this component when calculating production capacity for this product."

### About Production Capacity

**Q: "How does the system calculate how many products I can make?"**
A: "The system checks your current inventory for each component required in the product's BOM. It divides the available quantity of each component by the quantity required in the BOM. The component that allows the fewest complete products determines your maximum production capacity."

**Q: "Why does the system say I can only make 5 units when I have plenty of most components?"**
A: "Production capacity is limited by the scarcest component. If one component in the BOM has limited stock, it will restrict how many complete products you can assemble, even if you have excess stock of other components."

## Best Practices for BOM Management

1. **Regular Review**: Periodically review BOMs to ensure they reflect current product designs
2. **Component Standardization**: Use the same components across multiple products when possible
3. **Documentation**: Include clear component identifiers (SKUs) in the BOM
4. **Change Management**: Communicate BOM changes to production teams
5. **Version Control**: Consider maintaining BOM versions for different product revisions

## Technical Implementation

The BOM management functionality is implemented through:

1. A React-based user interface for viewing and editing BOMs
2. RESTful API endpoints for retrieving and updating BOM data
3. Database tables that store the relationships between products and components
4. Business logic that enforces data integrity and calculates production metrics

The system ensures that all BOM changes are immediately reflected in production planning and the AI assistant's knowledge base, providing consistent information across the platform.
