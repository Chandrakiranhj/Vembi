# Enhanced AI Assistant Capabilities

This document outlines the advanced capabilities that have been added to the Vembi AI Assistant to provide more context about the platform, improve navigation assistance, and enhance user interactions.

## New System Capabilities

### 1. Platform Context & Navigation

The AI assistant now has comprehensive knowledge about:
- The overall platform structure and modules
- Navigation paths to different sections
- UI elements and their functions
- Common workflows and processes

This allows the assistant to guide users through the platform more effectively, helping them find features and understand how to accomplish tasks.

### 2. Intent Detection

The assistant can now detect user intent from messages using pattern matching, including:
- Inventory queries
- BOM management questions
- Navigation assistance requests
- Production capacity inquiries
- Quality control and defect questions
- Document search requests
- Return processing questions
- General help requests

### 3. Contextual Help

Based on detected intent, the assistant provides relevant contextual help:
- For navigation questions: UI guidance and location information
- For help requests: Overview of available assistance categories
- For specific feature questions: Targeted information about that feature

### 4. Task Guidance

Step-by-step instructions for common tasks:
- Creating new assemblies
- Adding components to inventory
- Reporting quality defects
- Processing product returns

Users can ask "How do I create an assembly?" or similar questions to receive detailed guidance.

### 5. Inventory Trend Analysis

For inventory-related questions, the assistant can provide trend analysis:
- Usage patterns over time
- Estimated depletion timelines
- Reorder recommendations
- Vendor lead time information

### 6. Production Bottleneck Prediction

When discussing production capacity, the assistant can identify potential bottlenecks:
- Components with low stock levels
- Quality issues affecting production
- Vendor delays and supply chain disruptions
- Recommended actions to address bottlenecks

### 7. Document Integration

Enhanced document search and integration:
- More accurate document retrieval based on user intent
- Better summarization of relevant document content
- Contextual presentation of document information

### 8. User Feedback Processing

The assistant can now collect and process user feedback:
- Thumbs up/down on responses
- Comment collection for improvement
- Feedback tracking for continuous improvement

### 9. Personalized Responses

Response personalization based on:
- User role (admin, inventory manager, etc.)
- Previous interactions
- User's technical expertise level

## Implementation Details

The enhanced capabilities are implemented across several files:

1. **ai-config.ts**: Updated system prompt with platform context and navigation guidance
2. **ai-advanced-capabilities.ts**: New module containing advanced functionality
3. **ai-service.ts**: Modified to integrate advanced capabilities
4. **chat/route.ts**: Updated API endpoint to support new features

## How to Use the Enhanced AI Assistant

### For End Users

1. **Navigation Help**: Ask "How do I navigate to [feature]?" or "Where can I find [feature]?"
2. **Task Guidance**: Ask "How do I [create/add/report/process] [assembly/component/defect/return]?"
3. **Inventory Questions**: Ask about stock levels, component availability, or inventory trends
4. **Production Planning**: Ask about production capacity or potential bottlenecks
5. **Document Search**: Ask questions about procedures, guides, or company documentation
6. **General Help**: Ask "What can you help me with?" for an overview of capabilities

### For Administrators

1. **Adding Knowledge**: Use the Document Management tab to add new knowledge documents
2. **System Prompt**: Modify the system prompt in `ai-config.ts` to adjust AI behavior
3. **Intent Patterns**: Update intent detection patterns in `ai-advanced-capabilities.ts` to improve accuracy
4. **Task Guidance**: Add new task guides in the `getTaskGuidance` function

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to consider:

1. **Conversational Memory**: Longer-term memory of user interactions and preferences
2. **Proactive Suggestions**: AI-initiated suggestions based on user activity
3. **Visual Guidance**: Integration with UI to provide visual cues and highlights
4. **Voice Interface**: Adding speech recognition and synthesis for hands-free operation
5. **Predictive Analytics**: More sophisticated trend analysis and forecasting
6. **Multi-language Support**: Localization for international users
7. **User Behavior Analysis**: Learning from user interactions to improve guidance

## Feedback and Continuous Improvement

The AI assistant is designed to improve over time through:

1. User feedback collection via thumbs up/down buttons
2. Analysis of common questions and pain points
3. Regular updates to the knowledge base
4. Refinement of intent detection patterns
5. Addition of new task guidance workflows

Please report any issues or suggestions for improvement to the development team.
